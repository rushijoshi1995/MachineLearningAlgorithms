Classification:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies a data point based on the majority label of its nearest neighbors.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
Decision Trees: Classifies data by splitting it based on feature values.
Random Forests: An ensemble of decision trees to improve classification performance.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Neural Networks: Can be used for both classification and regression tasks, especially in deep learning.
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): Ensemble methods that build strong classifiers by combining weaker models.
