# Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various classification algorithms in machine learning. Classification is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to predict the categorical label of a given input based on past observations. This is widely used in areas such as medical diagnosis, spam detection, and image classification.

### What are Classification Algorithms?

Classification algorithms are a subset of supervised learning techniques that assign discrete labels or categories to new observations based on learned patterns from labeled training data. The model is trained on a dataset containing features and their corresponding labels, and it learns to map the input features to the correct label. The key objective is to generalize well to unseen data.

Some common types of classification algorithms include:

- **Binary Classification:** Where the output variable has two possible outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Multiclass Classification:** Where the output variable has more than two possible outcomes (e.g., classifying types of flowers).
- **Multilabel Classification:** Where multiple labels can be assigned to each input (e.g., tagging an image with multiple categories).

### Implemented Algorithms

This repository covers the following classification algorithms:

1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Gradient Boosting Algorithms**
   - **XGBoost**
   - **LightGBM**
7. **Neural Networks**

Each algorithm has its own folder containing the implementation, dataset, and a detailed README file explaining the specifics of that algorithm.

## 1. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

### What is kNN?
k-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It works by finding the 'k' nearest neighbors of a data point and assigning the most common label among those neighbors to the point.

## 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### What is SVM?
Support Vector Machine is a powerful algorithm that works well for both linear and non-linear classification. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data points into different classes. SVM aims to maximize the margin between different classes, which makes it robust to outliers.

## 3. Decision Trees

### What are Decision Trees?
Decision Trees are a type of algorithm that splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features. It works by creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final output.

## 4. Random Forest

### What is Random Forest?
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. It reduces the variance of individual decision trees by averaging them, leading to a more robust model.

## 5. Naive Bayes

### What is Naive Bayes?
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between every pair of features. Despite the strong assumption of independence, Naive Bayes performs well in various applications, particularly in text classification.

## 6. Gradient Boosting Algorithms

### What is Gradient Boosting?
Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification tasks, which builds a model in a stage-wise fashion from weak learners, typically decision trees. It optimizes for a given loss function by adding models that reduce the residuals of previous models.

#### 6.1 XGBoost
XGBoost is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting, designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It incorporates a variety of systems and algorithmic optimizations to enhance performance and accuracy.

[XGBoost Algorithm Documentation](./XGBoost/Readme.md)

#### 6.2 LightGBM
LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient, particularly with large-scale data. LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise rather than level-wise, which helps reduce loss more than the level-wise approach.

## 7. Neural Networks

### What are Neural Networks?
Neural Networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering of raw input. They consist of layers of nodes, where each node mimics the functioning of a neuron.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of different classification algorithms, including their implementation and theoretical background. Each algorithm folder includes a detailed README file that explains the inner workings of the algorithm, along with code and examples. This project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand and implement classification algorithms in machine learning.
